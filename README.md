## Meet Sheets

**Sheets is a free desktop spreadsheet for Windows and macOS that opens and saves Excel `.xlsx` files.**
It has the tools you already know (a ribbon, the formula bar, ~490 Excel functions, charts,
PivotTables, AutoFill and Excel's keyboard shortcuts) in a download of about 4 MB instead of
gigabytes. No subscription, no account, no telemetry.

It's built around one promise: **a spreadsheet must never silently change or lose your data.**
Sheets keeps leading zeros, long IDs and gene names exactly as you typed them, saves your work
every 30 seconds (even a workbook you never saved), and keeps the previous version every time you
save.

**Made for**

- 🎓 **Students**: a real spreadsheet without a subscription, light enough for any laptop.
- 🏪 **Small businesses**: invoices, budgets and stock lists in the `.xlsx` files your accountant already uses.
- 📊 **Analysts**: the shortcuts, KeyTips, XLOOKUP, Paste Special and Flash Fill your hands already know.
- 🔬 **Researchers**: sample IDs, accession numbers and gene names that stay exactly as typed.
- 🍎 **Mac users**: the same app, files and shortcuts (with ⌘) as your Windows colleagues.

Sheets is written in Rust ([Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) and the
[IronCalc](https://github.com/ironcalc/IronCalc) engine) with a React/TypeScript interface, and
it's open source under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

</p>

## Meet Docs

**New in 0.5: Sheets comes with Docs, a word processor that opens and saves Word `.docx` files.**
Like Word next to Excel, Docs installs with Sheets, has its own **Docs** entry in the Windows
Start menu and opens your `.docx` files with a double-click. In either app, the app button at
the left of the title bar opens the other one.

Docs has the Word tools you use every day: the ribbon (Home, Insert, Design, Layout, References,
Review, View), styles and the Navigation pane, lists, tables, pictures, headers and footers, page
numbers, footnotes, a table of contents, comments and Track Changes, laid out on real pages as
you type. What Docs can't edit yet (charts, SmartArt, equations, content controls…) is kept
exactly as it was, so a document from Word goes back to Word intact. It has the same safety net
as Sheets: AutoRecover, Document Recovery, unsaved documents and version history.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/docs-screenshot.png" width="100%" alt="The Docs window: Home ribbon with font, paragraph and styles groups; the Navigation pane listing the headings of an annual report; page 2 of the report with headings, a paragraph, a revenue table with a caption and a bulleted list.">

## Download

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/Dipendra-creator/sheets-desktop/releases/latest"><img src="docs/assets/download-windows.svg" height="64" alt="Download for Windows"></a>
  &nbsp;
  <a href="https://github.com/Dipendra-creator/sheets-desktop/releases/latest"><img src="docs/assets/download-macos.svg" height="64" alt="Download for macOS"></a>
</p>

Both buttons open the [latest release](https://github.com/Dipendra-creator/sheets-desktop/releases/latest).
Pick the file for your computer:

| Platform | File to download |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows 10/11** (64-bit) | `Sheets_<version>_x64-setup.exe`: the installer (recommended, no admin rights needed) |
| | `Sheets_<version>_x64_en-US.msi`: for IT deployment (Intune, Group Policy) |
| | `Sheets_<version>_x64-portable.exe`: a single file, nothing to install |
| **macOS, Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4) | `Sheets_<version>_aarch64.dmg` |
| **macOS, Intel** | `Sheets_<version>_x64.dmg` |

Every download contains both apps. The installer adds **Sheets** and **Docs** to the Start menu
and opens `.xlsx`, `.csv` and `.docx` files; on the Mac, `Sheets.app` opens your `.docx` files in
Docs, and the app button in the title bar switches between the two. The portable `.exe` starts
Docs with `--docs`.

<details>
<summary><b>First launch</b>: the builds aren't code-signed yet</summary>
<br>

- **Windows**: if SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC", click **More info → Run anyway**.
- **macOS**: drag Sheets to Applications, then the first time **right-click → Open → Open**.
  If macOS reports the app as damaged, run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Sheets.app`.

</details>

**Updates:** from version 0.4.0, Sheets tells you when a new version is out. An **Update
available** button appears in the title bar; click it, then **Restart to update**. Workbooks with
unsaved changes are kept and offered again after the restart. (Help → Check for Updates; turn
automatic checks off in Options. The portable `.exe` never installs anything: it shows the update
and links to the new portable file.) Coming from 0.3.0 or earlier? Install the latest version once
from the Releases page.

## Features

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/features-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/features-light.svg" width="100%" alt="Nine features: your .xlsx stays .xlsx; ~490 Excel functions; charts and PivotTables; AutoFill and Flash Fill; the Excel shortcuts you know; AutoRecover every 30 seconds; version history; Check Workbook; updates itself.">
</picture>

<details>
<summary><b>Everything Sheets can do</b></summary>
<br>

- **Files**: open and save `.xlsx`/`.xlsm`, `.csv`, `.tsv`/`.txt`; templates; recent and pinned
  files; drag and drop to open; opening a file while Sheets runs reuses the running app.
- **Safety**: AutoRecover and Document Recovery, Recover Unsaved Workbooks, version history,
  crash-safe atomic saves, data-integrity guards (Options → *Data integrity*).
- **Editing**: in-cell and formula-bar editing, point mode with coloured references, function
  autocomplete and argument hints, F4 absolute references, Format Painter, Find & Replace, Go To,
  unlimited undo/redo, AutoComplete and Alt+↓ pick lists.
- **AutoFill**: the fill handle works like Excel's. Drag, Ctrl+drag or double-click it, then use
  the **AutoFill Options** button to switch between Copy Cells, Fill Series, Formatting Only,
  Without Formatting and Fill Days / Weekdays / Months / Years. Numbers, dates, `Item 1`, `1st`,
  `Q1`, month and day names continue as series; Home → Fill → Series… sets step, stop and trend;
  **Flash Fill** (Ctrl+E) fills a column from an example.
- **Paste Special**: formulas, values, formats, column widths, Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide,
  Skip blanks, Transpose and Paste Link (Ctrl+Alt+V); Ctrl+Shift+V pastes values.
- **Formatting**: fonts, colours, borders, alignment, wrap, merge, number formats with live
  preview, cell styles, Format as Table, conditional formatting (rules, data bars, colour scales,
  icon sets).
- **Formulas**: ~490 Excel functions including dynamic arrays (`FILTER`, `SORT`, `UNIQUE`,
  `SEQUENCE`), `XLOOKUP` and `LET`; Name Manager; Show Formulas; **Check Workbook**.
- **Data**: sort (quick and multi-level), **AutoFilter**, Remove Duplicates, **Text to Columns**,
  **PivotTable** summaries built from live `SUMIFS`/`COUNTIFS` formulas.
- **Charts**: column, bar, line, area, pie, doughnut and scatter. They update with the data, skip
  filtered rows, can be moved and resized, and are saved inside the `.xlsx`.
- **Review**: cell notes (Excel comments are imported), links (Ctrl+click to open), workbook
  statistics.
- **View & print**: freeze panes, zoom, gridlines and headings, command search (Alt+Q),
  Print / Save as PDF with orientation, fit to width, gridlines and headings, multiple windows.
- **Updates**: background checks, signed downloads verified before installing, and a one-click
  restart that keeps unsaved workbooks.
- **Platforms**: Windows 10/11 and macOS 10.15+ (Apple Silicon and Intel), with native window
  controls and ⌘ shortcuts on the Mac.

<details>
<summary><b>Everything Docs can do</b></summary>
<br>

- **Files**: open and save Word documents (`.docx`); open `.docm`, `.dotx` and `.dotm` (saved as
  a new `.docx`, never over the original), plain text and Markdown; export as plain text,
  Markdown or a single-file web page; Print / Save as PDF; nine templates (resume, cover letter,
  business letter, report, meeting notes, event flyer…); recent and pinned documents.
- **Faithful round trips**: Docs edits the document in place. Parts it doesn't edit (charts,
  SmartArt, equations, text boxes, content controls, embedded objects, custom XML) are written
  back unchanged, and the document keeps its own styles, settings and theme.
- **Safety**: AutoRecover, Document Recovery after a crash, Recover Unsaved Documents, version
  history (File → Info), crash-safe saves.
- **Text and paragraphs**: fonts, sizes, colours, highlight, underline styles, strikethrough,
  sub/superscript, caps and small caps, Change Case, Format Painter, Clear Formatting; alignment,
  indents (on the ruler too), line and paragraph spacing, shading, borders, tab stops, keep with
  next / keep lines together / page break before; formatting marks.
- **Styles**: the Styles gallery and pane with the document's own styles; headings drive the
  Navigation pane (with search) and the table of contents.
- **Lists**: bullets, numbering and multilevel lists that continue Word's numbering; Tab and
  Shift+Tab change the level.
- **Tables**: insert from a grid, rows and columns, merge and split cells, table styles,
  shading, cell alignment, header rows repeated on every page.
- **Pictures**: insert, paste or drag in; resize, alt text; floating pictures keep their position
  and wrapping from the file.
- **Pages**: margins, orientation, paper size, page and section breaks, cover pages and blank
  pages; headers and footers (different first page, odd & even pages, per section) with page
  numbers; watermarks, page colour and page borders (Design tab).
- **References**: table of contents, footnotes and endnotes at the bottom of each page,
  captions, cross-references, bookmarks; page number, page count, date and time fields (F9
  updates them).
- **Review**: comments, Track Changes with Accept / Reject, word count, accessibility check,
  spell check as you type.
- **View**: Print Layout, Read Mode, Web Layout and Draft; zoom, One Page, Page Width; Find and
  Replace, Go To; command search (Alt+Q); KeyTips (Alt); multiple windows.

## Why Sheets?

Excel's best-known failures are silent: data changed on import, work lost in a crash, a formula
range that stops one row short. Sheets fixes these by default.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/integrity-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/integrity-light.svg" width="100%" alt="What you type is what you keep. 00501 (a ZIP code): Excel shows 501, Sheets keeps 00501. 4111111111111111 (a 16-digit card number): Excel shows 4.11111E+15 and stores the last digit as 0, Sheets keeps all 16 digits. SEPT1 (a gene name): Excel shows 1-Sep, Sheets keeps SEPT1. café in a UTF-8 CSV file: Excel shows cafÃ©, Sheets detects the encoding and shows café.">
</picture>

| Problem in Excel | What Sheets does |
| --- | --- |
| `00501` becomes `501`; the card number `4111111111111111` becomes `4.11111E+15` and is stored as `4111111111111110` | Leading zeros and numbers longer than 15 digits are kept exactly: typed, pasted or imported |
| Gene names such as `SEPT1` / `MARCH1` turn into dates (27 human genes were renamed because of this) | Only complete dates are converted |
| AutoRecover every 10 minutes, and only for files saved at least once | AutoRecover 30 s after every change, for every workbook, with a recovery screen after a crash |
| "Don't Save" is final | Unsaved workbooks are kept for 7 days |
| No local version history | Every save keeps the previous version (File → Info) |
| CSV files open with garbled accents; "Save as CSV" rounds numbers to their display format | UTF-8/UTF-16/Windows-1252 detection; CSV saved as UTF-8 with BOM and full precision |
| 100-step undo, cleared by macros | Unlimited undo; big actions are one step |
| Formula mistakes are small green triangles (the Reinhart–Rogoff and "London Whale" errors) | **Review → Check Workbook** lists errors, inconsistent formulas and totals that skip numbers across every sheet |
| 4 GB (Windows) / 10 GB (macOS) of disk space and a subscription | ≈ 4 MB installer (≈ 5 MB on a Mac), ≈ 12 MB installed; free, no account, no telemetry |

## Roadmap

Planned next: data validation, notes and charts that Excel can display, page setup, formula
auditing arrows, refreshable PivotTables, Linux packages, code-signed installers and co-authoring.
For Docs: text columns, mixed page sizes and orientations, legacy `.doc` import, direct PDF export,
editable text boxes and shapes, and mail merge.
See **[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)** for the Excel and Word feature-parity matrices and the
release plan, and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each version.

## Build from source

Prerequisites: Rust (stable), Node 20+, pnpm 10.
Windows needs WebView2 (preinstalled on Windows 10/11); Linux needs
`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` (see the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev          # development with hot reload
pnpm tauri build        # release build + installers in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

Tests:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test --lib                                                     # engine, storage, recovery, features
cargo test --release --lib perf_large_sheet -- --ignored --nocapture  # performance smoke test
cd .. && pnpm typecheck                                              # TypeScript
```

The README images are built by [`docs/assets/build.py`](docs/assets/build.py)
(`pip install fonttools uharfbuzz`, with the Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts installed).

<details>
<summary><b>Releasing</b> (maintainers)</summary>
<br>

1. Bump the version in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `package.json`,
   and add a section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Push (or merge) the change to `main`. Pushing a matching tag (`git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0`)
   or running the **Release** workflow from the Actions tab works too.
3. [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) sees that this version has no
   release yet, builds Windows (installer, MSI, portable) and macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel DMGs)
   in parallel, uploads them to a draft release with the notes from
   [`.github/release-notes.md`](.github/release-notes.md), and publishes it (creating the `vX.Y.Z`
   tag) when every build has succeeded. Pushes that don't change the version don't release anything.

**In-app updates** need the update-signing key as repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions): `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (the private key file's contents) and, if the
key has a password, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`. The matching public key is
`plugins.updater.pubkey` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. With the secret set, each release gets
signed update files and a `latest.json`, and installed copies update themselves. Without it the
build stops with an error and the release stays a draft: add the secret and re-run the **Release**
workflow (a repository variable `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_RELEASE` = `true` builds an unsigned release
anyway, which the app only announces). Keep the private key safe: if it is lost,
generate a new pair (`pnpm tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/sheets.key`), put the new public
key in `tauri.conf.json`, and users install that release once by hand.

</details>

## Architecture

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/architecture-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/architecture-light.svg" width="100%" alt="How Sheets is built: a React and TypeScript desktop UI (canvas grid, ribbon and KeyTips, formula bar, dialogs, SVG charts, update button) sends typed commands over Tauri IPC to a Rust core and gets screen-ready cells back. The Rust core has a Session (edits and undo), the IronCalc engine, Recovery, Storage and Updates. Storage reads and writes plain .xlsx and .csv files; Updates fetches signed update files from GitHub Releases.">
</picture>

- **Rust owns the data.** The UI keeps only a cache of the visible cells. Every edit is a
  command; the backend returns `WorkbookInfo` and the UI refetches just the visible window.
- **Canvas grid.** Virtualised rendering with frozen panes, merges, text overflow, wrap,
  borders, data bars/icons, filter buttons and note markers, drawn in device pixels.
- **One undo step per user action.** `Session` groups engine operations and snapshots the
  extras (merges, notes, charts, filters) that IronCalc does not track.
- **Everything in one file.** Notes, charts and filter criteria are stored as JSON in a
  *very hidden* worksheet, the standard way add-ins keep private data in a workbook. Excel
  preserves it without showing it; Sheets strips it on load and re-creates it on save.
- **Docs edits the document, not a copy.** A `.docx` is read into a ProseMirror document;
  everything the editor doesn't understand travels along as an untouched XML island. Saving
  replays the edits onto the package that was opened, so untouched parts stay byte-for-byte.
- **One program, two apps.** Each window is a Sheets or a Docs window (`--docs` starts in Docs);
  both share sessions, AutoRecover, version history, settings and updates.
- **Extension points** for a future database layer: `storage::WorkbookStore`,
  `templates::TemplateProvider`, `sync::SyncBackend` (every edit already produces an IronCalc
  diff batch for live sync).

## Known limitations

- Charts and notes are saved in the `.xlsx` and restored by Sheets, but Excel does not display
  them yet (planned: native Excel charts and comments).
- Not yet available: pictures and shapes, data validation, sheet protection, page margins and
  headers/footers, formula auditing arrows, spell check, indent and text rotation.
- `.xls` (legacy binary) files are not supported; save them as `.xlsx` in Excel first.
- `.xlsm` workbooks open normally, but macros are neither run nor kept. Sheets never overwrites
  the original: saving writes a copy as `.xlsx`.
- IronCalc recalculates the whole workbook after each edit: instant for typical sheets,
  ~150 ms for 500k filled cells. Fraction number formats render incorrectly in this
  IronCalc version.
- Builds are not code-signed or notarized yet (see *Download*).
- **Docs**: text columns are kept but shown as one column; a document uses the page size and
  orientation of its last section; EMF/WMF pictures show as placeholders (kept in the file);
  charts, SmartArt, equations and text boxes are kept but can't be edited; legacy `.doc`, `.rtf`
  and `.odt` don't open yet; PDF goes through the print dialog. On the Mac, Docs opens from a
  `.docx` file or the app button in Sheets (there is no separate Docs app icon).
